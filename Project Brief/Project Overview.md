📄 Project Overview — Multi-Asset Trading Simulator Platform

The project is a full-fledged multi-segment trading and brokerage simulation ecosystem designed to mirror the operations of a real-world securities broker, built entirely on modern, open-source enterprise technology. It delivers a unified environment where traders, brokers, and exchange operators can interact over simulated but realistic market conditions for the Indian financial markets—covering BSE/NSE cash equities, derivatives (futures and options), and MCX commodities.

At its core, the system is a JHipster-generated monolith based on Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and React, with WebSockets powering live market data and portfolio updates. Real-time quote feeds from the Zerodha Kite API inject authentic market movement, while a custom order-matching and risk engine handles order execution, margin validation, and MTM accounting using brokerage-grade logic. The Trader App provides a seamless UI for placing trades, managing positions, and tracking P&L with professional-level charting and reports. The Broker Admin Portal manages client accounts, fund journals, settlements, and regulatory-style reporting, while the Exchange Operator Console governs symbol masters, contract specifications, and daily settlement data.

The entire platform follows test-driven development (TDD), domain-driven design, and JHipster/React best practices, ensuring modular code, DTO separation, and reusable UI components. Security is enforced through Keycloak-based OAuth2, and the system adheres to strict coding, documentation, and CI/CD standards (JUnit5, Jest, Cypress, SonarQube). Architecturally, it supports 1,000+ concurrent users with predictable latency, fault-tolerant batch processing, and structured reporting through an integrated ledger and accounting layer.

Ultimately, this project is a realistic, educational, and regulatory-aware brokerage simulator—a sandbox for learning and experimentation that reproduces the mechanics of real exchanges, while remaining safe, auditable, and cloud-ready for future scaling into production-grade environments.
